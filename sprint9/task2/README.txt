Sprint9 Question2
Given a text containing brackets  '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'.
Sequences "\\(", "\\)", "\\[", "\\]", "\\{" and "\\}" are not brackets.
Write a boolean verifyBrackets(String text) method of the MyUtils class to check a input text.
The brackets must close in the correct order, for example "()", "()[]{}", "{(())}" and "(\\()" are all valid but "(]", ")(" and "([)]" are not.
